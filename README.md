# Touch


A command line application (CLI) that allows for quick file creation. Should also work crossplatform as this is dart, but was mainly made for the windows OS as cmd.exe does not have "touch" command built in.


## Usage


Please ensure that you first compile an executable file:

dart compile exe bin\touch.dart


Then set in path on windows.


If you are not sure how to use the application after set, run touch -h or in the bin folder, touch.exe -h

## Contributions

I do not think there is a lot to contribute to this simple tool, but if you do feel that there is anything required, please feel free to open A PR and I will happily look at your code and decide.
